# Make-a-website-responsive
One of the exercises of the Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree

Objectives of the exercise:

- Add a <meta> viewport to the page with initial scale set.

- Adjust CSS and markup so that everything displays in a single column. Use relative widths so that things stretch to fit across any viewport width.

- Have sure touch targets are easy to hit.

- Test the site across different viewports. Try on different phones, tablets and desktops.
